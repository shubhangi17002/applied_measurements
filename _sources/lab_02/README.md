Lab 2 - Heat Pipe

The objectives of this experiment are:

1. Understand the heat transfer characteristics of a heat pipe
2. Observe the thermal response time of a heat pipe in comparison to a copper rod
3. Measure the response time and temperature profile along the heat pipe
4. Calculate the effective thermal conductivity of the heat pipe and compare it with high thermal conductivity materials
