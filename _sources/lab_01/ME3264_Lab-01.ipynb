    "#### System\n",
    "The system is whatever we want to study. It may be as simple as a free body or\n",
    "as complex as an entire chemical refinery. Everything external to the system is considered to be part of the system’s surroundings.The system is distinguished from its surroundings by a specified boundary, which may be at rest or in motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of systems - closed systems (control amss) and open systems (control volumes). A closed system refers to a fixed quantity of matter, whereas a control volume is a region of space through which mass may flow. For exmaple, a quantity of matter contained within a closed, rigid-walled tank is a closed system, while a pipeline through which natural gas flows can be considered as control volume. Closed systems are impermeable to mass but may be permeable to energy. When closed system are impermeable to both mass and energy transfer, the system is known as isolated system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System property\n",
    "To describe a system and predict its behavior requires knowledge of its properties\n",
    "and how those properties are related. A property is a macroscopic characteristic of a\n",
    "system such as mass, volume, energy, pressure, and temperature to which a numerical\n",
    "value can be assigned at a given time without knowledge of the previous behavior\n",
    "(history) of the system [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "The word \"state\" refers to the condition of a system as described by its properties.\n",
    "Since there are normally relations among the properties of a system, the state often\n",
    "can be specified by providing the values of a subset of the properties. All other properties\n",
    "can be determined in terms of these few [2].\n",
    "#### Process and cycle\n",
    "When any of the properties of a system changes, the state changes and the system\n",
    "is said to undergo a process. If a system undergo sequence of processes that begins and ends at the same state, the system is said to complete thermodynamic cycle.\n"
